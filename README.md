## About Me

I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer. 

I recently graduated from Durham University with a degree in Natural Sciences. My background and degree programme mainly consisted of Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy, but in my Second Year at University, I had my first exposure to Computer Science and Software Development. Within these disciplines, I found a unique opportunity to capitalise on my natural curiosity, leverage my problem-solving and analytical skills, and work within a collaborative environment to create meaningful solutions for businesses and consumers. After graduating, I enrolled in the School of Code, which has been a fantastic opportunity to develop these skills further in an accelerated learning environment and start building solutions to real-world problems. Please find some examples below.

## Projects

### Playlist Manager

#### Motivation:
As a Spotify user, I find my playlists become too large to manage easily. I wanted a tool which let me filter my playlists by a given set of genres, and create sub-playlists using these filters.

#### Solution:

I am creating a web application which allows the user to select one of their Spotify playlists, filter it by genre and create a sub-playlist
