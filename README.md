## About Me

I am an aspiring Graduate Data Scientist. 

I recently graduated from Durham University with a degree in Natural Sciences. My background and degree modules were in Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy, but I chose to integrate Computer Science and Software Development during my second and third years. Within these disciplines, I found a unique opportunity to capitalise on my natural curiosity, leverage my problem-solving and analytical skills, and work within collaborative environments to create meaningful solutions for businesses and consumers. After graduating, I enrolled in the School of Code, which has been a fantastic opportunity to develop these skills further in an accelerated learning environment and start building solutions to real-world problems. Please find some examples below.

## Projects

### Eslando - Relabel Digital Product Passports

#### Problem:
Consumers do not have easy access to sustainability information about their clothing.

#### Stakeholder and Solution:

Eslando create digital product passports which store and share a productâ€™s sustainability information using QR codes. We have built a front-end application which consumers are brought to after scanning one of these QR codes.

Please scan the QR code to see an example:

### Playlist Manager

#### Motivation:
As a Spotify user, I find my playlists become too large to manage easily. I wanted a tool which let me filter my playlists by a given set of genres, and create sub-playlists using these filters.

#### Solution:

I am creating a web application which allows the user to select one of their Spotify playlists, filter it by genre and create a sub-playlist

### Sudoku Solver

#### Motivation:
I have always enjoyed solving Sudoku puzzles and wanted to test my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

#### Solution:

I created an application which retrieves a Sudoku puzzle from the Dosuku API and solves it using a brute force algorithm.
