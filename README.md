## About Me

I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer. 

I recently graduated from Durham University with a degree in Natural Sciences. My background and degree programme mainly consisted of Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy, but in my Second Year at University, I had my first exposure to Computer Science and Software Development. Within these disciplines, I found a unique opportunity to capitalise on my natural curiosity, leverage my problem-solving and analytical skills, and work within a collaborative environment to create meaningful solutions for businesses and consumers. After graduating, I enrolled in the School of Code, which has been a fantastic opportunity to develop these skills further in an accelerated learning environment and start building solutions to real-world problems. Please find some examples below.

## Projects

### Spotify Project
<a href="https://github.com/alexcurwood/SpotifyProject">Repository Link</a>
#### Problem:
The Spotify app does not allow for functionality requested by users.

#### Solution:
Conduct research regarding which features users would like implemented.

Use this research to create a prioritised list of features to implement within an external Spotify Web Application.

Study the Spotify API documentation.

Create a clear plan for implementing each feature using the Spotify API tools.

Integrate each feature into my web application, obtaining user feedback and reflecting after each.

Use the feedback to iterate on each feature, continually conducting user testing.

Adapt my plans for future features using the knowledge gained.

#### Retrospective:
The opportunity to study the documentation of and implement the Spotify API within my application was challenging but highly rewarding.
In future, I will continue to conduct and analyse user research and integrate end-user testing into my development pipeline, to ensure my solutions directly provide value to the end user. I will start to integrate product design more into my development pipeline, to gain feedback as early as possible and iterate on my UX/UI.
