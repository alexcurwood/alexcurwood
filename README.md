## About Me

Graduate Data Scientist.

Last year I graduated from Durham University in Natural Sciences, completing modules in Computer Science, Mathematics, Philosophy and Physics. I capitalised on my natural curiosity and developed my problem-solving, analytical and statistical skills. 

After graduating, to bridge the gap between technical knowledge and practical software engineering experience, I enrolled at the School of Code. Rapidly learning new frameworks and applying them in hackathons and projects, alongside working in agile teams to create real-world solutions for stakeholders has provided a unique advantage over other graduates.

I am now looking to leverage my skills and experience as a Graduate Data Scientist and create meaningful solutions for businesses and consumers.

## Projects

### University Data Science Project

#### Brief:
Develop 2 basic and 2 enhanced Python algorithms to solve the travelling salesman problem – finding the shortest path visiting every city given a list of cities and distances.

### Eslando - Relabel Digital Product Passports

#### Problem:
Consumers do not have easy access to sustainability information about their clothing.

#### Stakeholder and Solution:

Eslando create digital product passports which store and share a product’s sustainability information using QR codes. We have built a front-end application which consumers are brought to after scanning one of these QR codes.

Please scan the QR code to see an example:

### Playlist Manager

#### Motivation:
As a Spotify user, I find my playlists become too large to manage easily. I wanted a tool which let me filter my playlists by a given set of genres, and create sub-playlists using these filters.

#### Solution:

I am creating a web application which allows the user to select one of their Spotify playlists, filter it by genre and create a sub-playlist

### Sudoku Solver

#### Motivation:
I have always enjoyed solving Sudoku puzzles and wanted to test my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

#### Solution:

I created an application which retrieves a Sudoku puzzle from the Dosuku API and solves it using a brute force algorithm.
