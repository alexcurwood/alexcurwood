I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer. Studying physics and mathematics throughout my education, I have a natural aptitude and interest in problem-solving and analytical disciplines. This interest motivated me to study Computer Science and experience software development as a part of my degree programme. Software development allows me to capitalise on my natural curiosity, problem solving, and collaborative skills by creating meaningful solutions for businesses and consumers. After graduating, I enrolled in the School of Code to continue developing my skills in an accelerated learning environment and best prepare myself for a Junior Software Developer role.

I am curious; willing to understand any problem or new concept given to me; team-ready; eager to ask for and receive feedback from my peers and superiors alike; and honest; able to identify my weakest areas and ask for assistance with humility. My training at the School of Code, professional experience, and education, have prepared me for intense learning environments: adapting quickly to a company’s technical and team infrastructure. These factors uniquely position me to rapidly deliver value as a Junior Software Developer.
